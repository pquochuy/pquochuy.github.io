I am a Research Scientist at Reality Labs @ Meta. Before joining Meta, I was a Sr. Research Scientist at Amazon Alexa/AGI. Before moving to industry, I was a Lecturer (Assistant Professor) in AI at the [School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science](http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/), [Queen Mary University of London](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/) (UK) and a Turing Fellow at [the Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/) (UK). At QMUL, I co-led [the Machine Listening Lab](http://machine-listening.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/) at [the Centre for Digital Music](http://c4dm.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/). Before that, I was a Lecturer in Computing at the [School of Computing](https://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/), [University of Kent](https://www.kent.ac.uk/) (UK) and a postdoctoral researcher in the [CIBIM lab](https://cibim.eng.ox.ac.uk/) at the [Department of Engineering Science](http://www.eng.ox.ac.uk/), [University of Oxford](http://www.ox.ac.uk/). 
<br/>
<br/>
I did PhD (summa cum laude) in Computer Science at the [Institute for Signal Processing](https://www.isip.uni-luebeck.de/), [University of Lübeck](https://www.uni-luebeck.de/) (Germany) under the supervision of [Prof. Alfred Mertins](https://www.isip.uni-luebeck.de/people/alfred-mertins). My PhD thesis on audio event detection was awarded the [Bernd Fischer Award](https://www.uni-luebeck.de/en/graduation/graduate-service/doctoral-awards/professor-bernd-fischer-preis-mint.html) for the best PhD thesis in 2018. In 2021, I was awarded IEEE-EMBS Best Paper Award 2019-20.
<!--- I received my M.Eng. (by research) in Computer Engineering from the [School of Computer Engineering](http://scse.ntu.edu.sg/), [Nanyang Technological University](http://ntu.edu.sg/) (Singapore) and my B.Sc. in Computer Science from the [University of Science at Ho Chi Minh City](http://web.hcmus.edu.vn/en/) (Vietnam).

<br/>
I investigate topics in the fields of machine learning/deep learning and signal processing. I am particularly interested in speech/audio processing, biosignal analysis, and healthcare applications.
<!---
My research interests include machine learning and signal processing with applications in environmental sound analysis and healthcare.
