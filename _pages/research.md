_“We do not have knowledge of a thing until we have grasped its why”_ - Aristotle

My current research activities involve in the following topics:

* **Deep learning/machine learning**<br/>*Representation learning and algorithms for temporal signal analysis (e.g. audio, speech, EEG, sEMG, fMRI, etc.)*

* **Machine hearing**<br/>*Audio event detection, audio scene analysis, speech enhancement*

* **Brain monitoring**<br/>*Automatic sleep staging, sleep micro-event detection, mobile EEG*

* **Pathological voice/speech/language analysis**<br/>*Parkinson's disease, personality disorder, etc.*

* **Hand prosthetics**<br/>*sEMG-based low-latency hand movement recognition/prediction, low-cost alternative sensors*

* **Digital biomarkers for mental health monitoring**<br/>
